## How the Game works
* You begin with 9 Open Boxes. 
* The Aim of the Game is to shut as many Boxes as Possible.
* Roll Two Dices, then close one or more Boxes such that the Sum
  of the Boxes closed is equal to your Dice Roll. 
* The Game Ends when you're unable to close boxes that are equal to your Dice Roll.
- Remember, a lower Score is better!!
